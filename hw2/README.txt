This homework contains the unittest for homework 1.

Credits: 
The original code for hw2 was forked from Zijun Wei. 
Then I rewrote the code so that the call that fetches the data is in it's own testable function.
For the test file, some of the standardized code is borrowed from https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/
