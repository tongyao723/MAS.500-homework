This homework contains the unittest for homework 1.

Credits: 
I forked Zijun Wei's homework 1 and rewrote the code so that the call that fetches the data is in it's own testable function.
For the test file, some of the standardized code is borrowed from https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/
